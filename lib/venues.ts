/**
 * Where the event is, and what that costs.
 *
 * The tier used to carry a flat transport figure - S/60 for boxes, S/300 for
 * plated - regardless of whether the van was going ten minutes down the road
 * or ninety minutes south to Asia. That is not a rounding error: at the far
 * end of Lima it understates the line by several hundred soles, and the
 * shortfall comes straight out of contribution.
 *
 * This module replaces that flat number with drive time, crew time and the
 * venue's own access. Every rate below is an UNVERIFIED estimate.
