/**
 * Quote maths for Aye Si Cena.
 *
 * Three rules this module exists to enforce, because getting any of them wrong
 * silently loses money on every event quoted:
 *
 *  1. IGV (18%) is stated explicitly. A quote is either NET (client pays
 *     price + IGV) or GROSS (the headline already contains IGV). Never assume.
 *  2. Canapes are sold per guest as a bite count, never per piece. The
 *     per-piece menu value is a costing device only.
 *  3. Per-event costs (menaje, staff, transport, packaging) come off before
 *     anything is called profit. Food cost alone overstates margin badly on
 *     plated service.
